<h2 class="h2">Copyright</h2>
Copyright is a form of protection so creators and subsequent owners of original works can control how the works are used. Copyright infringement occurs when a copyrighted work is reproduced, distributed, performed, publicly displayed, or made into a derivative work without the permission of the copyright owner. Violating the copyright owner’s rights can lead to suspension of that Content in your account on GoldFire, a <em>strike</em> and account suspension. These acts can be criminal. Additionally, copyright owners can take civil action against you and possibly be awarded monetary damages.

GoldFire complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and promptly suspends Content from access when properly notified.

To file a copyright infringement notification with GoldFire, you will need to send a written notification that includes substantially the information required by and stated in Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
<p class="mb-4">Persons or entities who have large numbers of files or a frequent need to notify GoldFire of copyright infringement may apply to GoldFire for access to GoldFire's DMCA Dynamic Notification System.</p>
